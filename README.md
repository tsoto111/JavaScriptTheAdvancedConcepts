# JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts

Playgound used to document small JavaScript snippets proving different concepts of the JavaScript language.

Lessons will be saved into different GIT branches.

## Run Project

We are using node to run our javascript files in our local terminal instead of using the browser. As a result, you can run `npm run start` to run the project file.
